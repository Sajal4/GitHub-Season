Difference between forEach() and map() ?

	forEach()
Functionality	Performs given operation on each element of the array	
Return value	Returns undefined	
Preferrable usage  	Performing non-tranformation like processing on each element.  

    map()
Functionality	 Performs given "transformation" on a "copy" of each element
Return value	 Returns new array with transformed elements, leaving back original array unchanged.
Preferrable usage   Obtaining array containing output of some processing done on each element of the array.
