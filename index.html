        <li>What is React?</li>
            <ul>React was created by jorden walke, a softwer engineer at facebook, in 2011, it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and insta.
            React is a open sorce frontend JS library, created by facebook, in 2011.It follows the component based approch for building resuable UI, component specialy for single page application and it used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.
            </ul>
        <ul>
            <Li>Why React ?</Li>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual DOM</li>
                <li>add third party libraby</li>
                <li>Oneway data buinding</li>
                <li>resuable  component</li>
                <li>JSX</li>
                <li>Performence</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <li>
            Explain Virtual DOM
        </li>
            <ul>ANS: DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</ul>

        <li>Explain diffing algorithm</li>
        </br>
        <li>REact, Angular or Veu</li>
        </br>
        <li>LIbray or framework</li>
        <ul>ANS: Library is a set of reusable functions used by computer programme and framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project , code calls the library but in framework , framework calls the code. in libray we can control the data flow by methods but in framework we dont have any control of the data flow framework decides how the dat awill flow that is nothing but frameworks callls the code. and in perfornmance wise react is having higher performance over angular and veu and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and react is having SPA(Single page application).</ul>
        <li>Why you have opted for React not Angular or Vue</li>
        <ul>ANS: Library is a set of reusable functions used by computer progrums and framework, It's a pice of code that dictates the archtectures of a project, code calls the libraby, but in framework it calls the code. In library we can control the data flow by methods, but in framework we don'thave any control of the data flow framework decides how the data will flow that is nothing but framework calls the code. </ul>

        <li>Class vs function component</li>
        <ul>Ans: Functional Components or stateless components are the most widely used type of components with a basic syntax of JavaScript Functions that return the JSX code or the HTML code.They are called as stateless components because they accept the data and display it accordingly and are mainly responsible for the rendering of the UI.Class based or stateful Components are the ES6 classes that extend the component class of the react library. They are known as stateful components because they are responsible for the implementation of the logic. It has different phases of the React lifecycle including rendering, mounting, updating and unmounting stage.</ul>
        <li>stateless vs stateful</li>
        <ul>Stateless component does not hold or manage state While statefu;ll component can hold or manage state, Stateless component are easy to understand but the statefull component it is complex as compared to the stateless components. Stateless component does not work with react lifecycles but whreas statefull work with lifecycle methods. Stateless can not be reused while can be used in case of statefull component.Stateless compnent is also known as functional component. Statefull is known as class component.</ul>
        <li>What are the different phases of React component's lifecycle?</li>
        <ul>
            In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases.
                <li>Initial Phase</li>
                <li>mounting</li>
                <li>updating</li>
                <li>unmounting</li>
            Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
        </ul>
            <li>What is Single Page Application or SPA? Explain the difference between SPA and MPA
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>In terms of speed of performance SPA no reloded is needes & responsivences</li>
                <li>MPA is haveing slow speed and performance is reloading</li>
                <li>accordingly coding reusable code for SPA & in MPA their is no option for reusablelity</li>
                <li>maintaince SPA having fast & easy maintaince & in MPA maintaince done for each page</li>
                <li>According SCO SPA is having limited optimization, According to user experience SPA is very smooth
                Where MPA user experience is too bad
                </li>
                <li>there is no loading required for SPA</li>
                <li>SPA sequares only mainpoint & MPA sequares end to end
                </li>
        </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Difference between state & props</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Difference between state & props</li>
            <li>state changes can be asynchronus</li>
            <li>props can be readonly</li>
            <li>props can be accessed by child component wherw state can't</li>
            <li>props are used for communicate between component where state used to change render dynamic changes within the component</li>
            
        </ul>
        <li>Explain props drilling concept and state uplifting</li>
        <ul>
            <li>porps drilling is a situation inthe same data sent to almost every element due to requirment of </li>
            <li>every component react has its own state because of these sometimes data can be reabandent & inconsistence so by lifiting up the state of parent component as a singlesourece of the truth & pass the data of childern to its parent</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?</li>
        <ul>
                <li>In the React component data is controlledby the React component or parent component</li>
                <li>in the uncontrolled componentdata is controlledby DOM itself</li>
                <li>control components allows validation control</li>
                <li>uncontrolled component doesn't allow validation control</li>
                <li>in control component it has better control over the forms and data</li>
                <li>in uncontrolled component limit control over the forms and data</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How to create Reusable components in React?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>through the props methods</li>
            <li>using parent component</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What are the three principles that Redux follows?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>single source of truth</li>
            <li>state is read only</li>
            <li>changes are made with pure function</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is React Router?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>react router is a standard library for routing in react it enable the navigation among the views of various components in react application.it allow changing the browser URL</li>
            <li>react router plays an important role to display multiple views in a SPA</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain difference between Browser Route, Route, Routes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API to keep our UI in sync with the url. It is the parent component that is used to store all the other components.
            </li>
            <li>Routes : It is the new component introduced in the V6 and a upgrade of a component. It is used to group all the route if there are more than 1 route components and routes are chosen based on best match.
            </li>
            <li>Route: it's the conditional component that renders some ui when paths is matched to current URL</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain React lifecycle</li>
        <ul>
            <li>each component in a react has a lyfecycle which you cam monitor & manipulates during its phases</li>
            <li>Initial phase</li>
            <li>mounting phase</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>constructor()</li>
                    <li>getDerivedStateFromProps()</li>
                    <li>render()</li>
                    <li>componentDidMount()</li>
                </ul>
            <li>updating phase</li>
            <li>unmounting phase</li>
        </ul>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
